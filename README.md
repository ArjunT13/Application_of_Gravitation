# Application_of_Gravitation

The features are:

* It can perform operations on complex or large data by using some in-built functions from C++ library and also using pointers and functions which are created in the program.
* The graphics feature used to show the orbit of satellite helps in easy understanding of science behind the Orbital Mechanics and conditions on orbits of launched satellite.
* This project can operate on supplied data from any random planet and give the specified parameters associated with it as an output.
* It helps in answering various questions related to planets and satellite launching.
* The primary focus of the project is on developing a program which can calculate the acceleration due to gravity on surface and also at certain specified height, and also calculate the time period of the planet according to the input given by user.
* It also provides the basic idea about various satellite launching conditions accordingly and helps to determine what should be the velocity of launching so that the satellite will get in a desired orbit.
* The calculation of energies associated with the satellite helps in getting a brief idea about how much energy would be required to be given to the satellite to escape from that orbit.
* It can work on data given from any type of planet and also makes complex mathematical calculations easier.
* Keplerâ€™s Law is used to calculate the Time period of the planet which gives us the idea about distance of planet from the star around which it is revolving.
